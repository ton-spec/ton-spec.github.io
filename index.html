      <h3>The Redemptive Project of God</h3>
      <p> The Redemptive Project of Man

After the failed coup whose master mind was the devil, the devil and a third of the angels were thrown on earth. He fell with anger and darkened the face of the deep and distorted the earth. The earth became void and  was without form. Elohim sought to rehabilitate the earth by causing His Spirit to hover over the face of the deep  before calling things into physical existence. 
<br>
In order to show the devil that He wasn’t insecure, Elohim decided to create Himself and hide in dust. The embodiment of Elohim would then invigorate the earth with God’s glory and overpower the devil and his evil agenda to corrupt God’s creation. Elohim sought to hide Himself in dust by creating man in His own image and likeness.Then man would multiply and subdue the earth with God's glory. To fulfill His agenda, He replicated the heavenly garden on earth as Eden, created man and put him there.
<br>
Man was available on God’s radar 24/7 and they were in constant koinonia kind of communication. In His bid to reveal Himself to the creation, Man was given the supernatural dominion  over the earth in which God would express Himself to the creation through man. He was commanded to multiply and subdue the earth.
<br><br>
        
‘What is man that you have made him a little bit lower than Elohim?’
‘The whole creation groans waiting for the earnest manifestation of the sons of God’
<br>
This  giant feat by the Trinity cut the devil to the heart  and made him burn with jealousy because the glory he coveted so much had been given to the dust. He therefore used cunning words to lure man out of God’s presence through the technology of rebellion, so he could steal man’s authority. The same technology that got him out of his initial heavenly environment.
<br>
 When man disobeyed God by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he lost his immortal abilities and dominion. The devil took over authority that was originally man’s. The devil’s agenda now was to subdue the earth with evil. To corrupt what was meant to be a blessing. Immediately man fell from God’s presence and went missing on God’s radar. The signal to locate him got lost . Elohim knew something was amiss and he went around the garden looking for him. Through the sin of one man, all men sinned and bore the consequences thereof. Since spirits are legalistic the penalty of sin would be death.
<br>
Now, Elohim is both loving and just in equal measure. So He was torn between killing the sinful man and saving him from perishing. To ransom man from this predicament, blood had to be shed as a price. They tried with blood of animals but that could not do better. Elohim devised a technology in which he could execute justice by killing the sinner and execute love by resurrecting the man -now a new creature free from sin, blood having washed away his sins. A feat that was fulfilled through the coming, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. A system that God used to save humanity.
<br>
God decided to pay the sin penalty through God the son.  He sneaked into the earthly realm through the womb of a woman- virgin Mary, wearing the flesh of man. He overcame sin through  all His life on earth as man. He was crucified, speared in the lateral side of His rib-cage, nailed, bitten with stripes, spitted on and disgraced. Bleeding was profuse - dangerous blood shed until His sweat was blood instead. He was subjected to unimaginable torture for along period of time until He gave up His Spirit and said it’s finished. Then, justice calmed God down because of the shedding of the blood of the lamb. 
<br>
His body was taken from the cross and buried  in the tomb by one rich Joseph of Arimathea. He then descended to hell where He took the key from the devil. God resurrected Him on the third day after His death. He defeated death. There was a great earthquake in which the angel of the Lord descended  in the form of lightening and rolled away the stone from the entrance to the tomb, to the shock of the guards who became like dead men. The guards were bribed not to declare the truth about the resurrection of Jesus, but to say that His disciples had come at night and stole His body while they were deep asleep. 
<br>
‘For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son , that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life’
<br>
Through one man’s death and and resurrection, the whole humanity died with Christ Jesus and resurrected with Him. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Whoever calls upon the name of Jesus shall be saved.
<br>
When you get saved , you are born again into the presence of Elohim- the  ancient Eden. You are born with the impregnable, invincible and glorious life of God. In so doing, you agree that you were saved from your spiritual and body sicknesses and diseases. Frequent eating of the body of Jesus Christ and drinking of His blood during  Holy Communion celebrations affirms this fact. You affirm that you and Jesus are one. This  works even in your finances and everything about you because the eternal unlimited life of God dwells in you. Christ Jesus the hope of glory.
<br>
‘If the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead dwells in you, it shall quicken your mortal   bodies’ 
‘By the stripes of Jesus Christ we were healed’
‘He became poverty that we may be rich’
<br>
Your authority and dominion even on earth is restored back to you because you  are now sited  with Christ Jesus in the heavenly places, at the right hand of God the father, far above the devil and his administration.
<br>
Salvation is in three dimensions. Your spirit is saved when you receive salvation because it becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit. However, you need to be filled with the Holy Spirit through baptism of the Holy Spirit and receive His power. Your mind is being saved by continual renewal of it through studying the word of God and aligning it to be consistent with the word of God alone. Faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God. The enemy likes attacking men from their minds. Faith is a defense system against attacks from the enemy. The final salvation dimension is the promise of celestial bodies that are incorruptible and immortal.
<br>
 Now that you are saved, you can ask  God the father of anything you want in the name of Jesus Christ and it shall be given to you.  Jesus is the only way, the truth and life. No one comes to God the father except through Jesus Christ. The name of Jesus Christ is above every other name in heaven, on earth and under the earth. At the mention of that name, every knee must bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord. Do not conform to the worldly patterns and belief systems but rather renew your mind by studying the word of God continually. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God. Our authority is in the name of Jesus. Men ought always to pray and not faint because prayer activates ancient environment of Eden and it possibilities and energies for you to function supernaturally  in this dark world. Prayer invites God  into the affairs of men and gives angels permission to act on God’s word in our lives. Seek deeper dimensions of God inside of you by praying in the Spirit and let his dimensions of glory be revealed in and through you.
 <br>

Those who do not believe in Jesus Christ and whose names are absent the book of life, will be thrown in the lake of fire to cry and gnash their teeth,  from where they will spend eternity which is the second death. God’s will is for all humans to be saved, and not to perish because the lake of fire was created for the devil and his evil angels. The lake of fire was not created for humans, that is why God created a system to save man. (Author: Tonny Wanjala Mulati – June, 2023) </p>
